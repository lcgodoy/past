Testing if two sets of polygons have some kind of association is not an easy task. The proof
of that is that we don't have a method implemented in neither in *R* or *ArcGIS* to do it.
So, by a request from researchers from *ESRI* (the company from *ArcGIS*), I developed an
algorithm based on the paper from [@lotwick1982]. The usage is illustrated below.
