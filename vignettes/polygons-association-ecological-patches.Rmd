Testing if two sets of polygons have some kind of association is not an easy task. The proof
of that is that we don't have a method  to do it implemented in neither in *R* or *ArcGIS*.
So, my dissertation was motivated by a request from researchers from *ESRI* 
(the company from *ArcGIS*) to my advisor. In this work I developed an
algorithm based on the paper from [@lotwick1982]. The usage is illustrated below.
